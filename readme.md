# InstaFetcher

The project appears to be a Node.js application that interacts with the Instagram Graph API to fetch media details for a user's Instagram account. It uses the axios library for making HTTP requests and the dotenv library for loading environment variables from a .env file. The main function initiates the data fetching process by calling the getMediaID function, which fetches the media IDs and their details. The fetchdetails function fetches the details for a specific media item, and the getMediaDetails function fetches the details for multiple media items. The fetched media details are then printed to the console.
